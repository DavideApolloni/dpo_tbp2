<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
This ontology was created to provide a framework aimed at sustaining digital preservation practices. Starting from a main repository, which is usually a dedicated external hard drive where files are stored, classes, object properties and data properties will help to define the relationships and dependances among the various files that are contained. The properties represent a basic starting point to take care of digital objects and their long-term preservations. As a matter of fact, adding the kind of information which is presented here is fundamental to ensure a better understanding and a more durable life to the digital objects. To provide a real-life implementation, the digital curation activity has been carried out here on the first of the three hard disks storing all the digital objects produced by Cineca Visit Lab, the 3D graphic laboratory located in Casalecchio di Reno (BO). The ontology will be implemented even on the other two hard disks, to ensure a better preservation to the files, other than testifying how a framework can be used and adapted even when the involved files are different. The final result shows an innovative way to take care of digital objects in order to assure them long-term preservation over years.</span>
